# ðŸ“Œ CNN vs. MLP Classification on CIFAR-10

This project compares the performance of a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** and a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** on a curated **3-class subset of CIFAR-10**. The CNN demonstrates superior feature extraction capabilities over the MLP.

---

## ðŸ“Š Results
- **CNN Test Accuracy:** ~ 87.47%
- **MLP Test Accuracy:** ~ 78.47%
- **Performance Gap:** 9.00%

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- **CNN Model:** Two convolutional layers with ReLU activation and MaxPooling.
- **MLP Model:** Two fully connected layers as a baseline comparison.
- **Data Handling:** Stratified train-test split and image visualization.
- **Optimization:** Adam optimizer and Cross-Entropy loss.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, F1-score, and Confusion Matrices.
